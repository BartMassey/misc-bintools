# misc-bintools: tiny tools
Bart Massey 2025

These are Rust rewrites of tiny tools that sit in my
personal bin and that I use regularly. The C source code for
some of them is semi-lost, and I'd prefer a solid Rust
implementation anyhow.

* `shuffle`: Shuffle lines of a file. Can be used as a
  filter.
